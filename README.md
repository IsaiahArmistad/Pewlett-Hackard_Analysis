# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### The purpose of this analysis is to find the number employees eligible to retire from Hewlett-Packard; after that the next deliverable is determining how many current employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
###  1) The 2 largest title of employees leaving are senior enginners and senior staff meaning Hewlett-Packard is going to be losing a lot of senior employees
### 2) Only 2 managers are retiring which means positions of leadership will remain largely unchanged even with the large amount of turnover
### 3) The Development, Production, and Sales Departments are losing the most employees to retirement, losing 9281, 8174, and 5860 employees respectively.
### 4) The Finance and Human Resources Departments are the only departments losing fewer than 2000 employees.

## Summary
### There are almost 36500 employees scheduled to retire from Hewlett-Packard. You can see that from adding all the total retirees from each department shown in the dept_retirements table. There are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation, there are only 1549 qualified employees, which falls well short of the amount that need to be replaced.
